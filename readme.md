# IRIXBASIC Codeless Language Module for TextWrangler and BBEdit

This is a BASIC programming language module for TextWrangler and BBEdit that supports the IRIXBASIC syntax.

Now, when you open an IRIXBASIC .BAS file, TextWranger performs syntax highlighting which makes editing code faster and easier. If you are editing an IRIXBASIC file that doesn't have a .BAS extension you can manually select IRIXBASIC from the languages pop-up menu at the bottom left of the TextWrangler document window.

## Installation 

To install the IRIXBASIC Language Module the file irixbasic.plist has to be copied into the TextWrangler / BBEdit Language Modules folder. If the directory "Language Modules" doesn't exist you can created it yourself using the File > New Folder menu item in finder.


for BBEdit the file goes in:

   > ~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Language Modules/ubasic.plist
   
   

for TextWranger the file goes in:

   > ~/Library/Application Support/TextWrangler/Language Modules/ubasic.plist


_Note: After you copy the Language Module file into place, restart TextWranger._
